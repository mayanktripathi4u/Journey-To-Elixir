# What is Ecto in Elixir?
Ecto is the official database wrapper and query DSL (Domain Specific Language) for Elixir. It allows you to:

- Interact with databases (e.g., Postgres, SQLite, MySQL)

- Define database schemas

- Perform validations and constraints

- Run database migrations

- Build and execute queries using Elixir syntax

# üí° Ecto's Core Components
|Component|	Description|
|--|--|
|Repo|	The interface to the database ‚Äî your access point for querying and commands|
|Schema|	Maps to a database table, using `use Ecto.Schema`|
|Changeset	|Manages changes to data, with validations and casting|
|Query DSL	|An Elixir-style syntax to write SQL-like queries|
|Migration|	Defines and applies changes to your database structure|

# Why Ecto Is Powerful
- Fully Elixir-native

- Type-safe queries

- Integrates easily with Phoenix framework

- Supports multi-database, sandboxing for tests

- You can use it outside of Phoenix (in plain Elixir projects like yours)

# Do I Need to Use Ecto?
Not necessarily. You can:

- Use raw SQL queries via libraries like `:esqlite`, `postgrex`, etc.

- Use **NIF-based** or **port-based** DB drivers directly

- For key-value or NoSQL, use Redis, ETS, Mnesia (no Ecto needed)

But you'd lose:

- Migrations

- Validations

- Query builder

- Struct ‚Üî row mapping

- Changeset benefits (clean data input, validation, transformation)


# Ecto Alternatives
|Alternative|	Notes|
|--|--|
|Tds.Ecto	|SQL Server adapter for Ecto|
|Mongo.Ecto	|MongoDB adapter for Ecto (outdated)|
|Xandra	|Native Cassandra driver, no Ecto|
|emento	|Wrapper around Elixir's built-in Mnesia DB|
|ETS / DETS	|In-memory or disk-based native Elixir storage (not relational)|
|Exqlite	|Lower-level wrapper for SQLite, often used under ecto_sqlite3|
|ableX	|Pattern-matching-based tabular data (non-SQL, not widely used)|

# When to Use Ecto?
|Use Case|	Should You Use Ecto?|
|--|--|
|CRUD app with relational DB	|‚úÖ Yes|
|Web app (Phoenix or not)	|‚úÖ Yes|
|Simple ETL or scripts	|ü§î Maybe|
|Embedded/in-memory fast storage	|‚ùå - Instead use ETS/Mnesia|
|NoSQL/graph store (e.g., Neo4j)	|‚ùå - Instead use native libs|


# Final Note

Ecto is your best friend when:

- You use SQL databases

- Want validation, changesets, migrations, and Elixir-style querying

If you're building a CLI tool, local script, or using NoSQL/Redis, then you might skip it.
