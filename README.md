# Journey To Elixir
Starting to learn new Functional Programming - Elixir

From today I am starting a new journey to learn Elixir - a Functional Programming Language. 

At initial it looks strange as I am coming from other programming language, which do have functional design patterns but its still probably a little bit strange than what I might be used to where we basically have function calls and we are we are piping values through the functions. Ignore for now if this is too much to have here. As a curious I just started looking bit far on Day-1 itself and found such.

Will share how my learning is going, findings, differences, similarities, eveything will be here in this repo.

While following along, also refer to [Concepts and FAQ](/Concepts-And-FAQ/) page where I will be adding all my learnings, and for code refer other directory based on interest defined below.

# Elixir in-short
To have a short description about Elixir.

- Elixir was designed from the beginning for building scalable applications & resilient applications. 

- One that can stay working even if things go wrong, its a functional programming language.

- Per definition from [official elixir document](http://elixir-lang.org),
> Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.

- Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency distributed and fault-tolerant systems.

I'm currently learning Elixir and will continue to update this guide as I discover more.
