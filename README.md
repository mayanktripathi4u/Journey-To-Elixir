# Journey To Elixir
Starting to learn new Functional Programming - Elixir

From today I am starting a new journey to learn Elixir - a Functional Programming Language. Being a programmer using OO concepts and now deep diving into functional world.

Will share how my learning is going, findings, differences, similarities, eveything will be here in this repo.

To have a short description about Elixir.

- Elixir was designed from the beginning for building scalable applications & resilient applications. 

- One that can stay working even if things go wrong, its a functional programming language.

- Per definition from [official elixir document](http://elixir-lang.org),
> Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.

- Elixir runs on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency distributed and fault-tolerant systems.
